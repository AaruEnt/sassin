Inside this folder you can use the "FlamePack" scene to interactively view the prefabs provided in this package.

Inside "ExtraScenes" folder you'll see some scenes with examples of color and style variants, as well as a simple model viewer.

Inside "ExampleOnlySceneAssets" you'll have access to color and style variant materials displayed in the extra scenes, but are not part of the core Velvara Flames package.

It has been organized this way so you can safely delete the entire "ExampleScenes" folder with no risk of deleting the core Velvara Flames package assets.
