All Pipelines:

- "Step Length", how long the ray will render volume inside the crystal.
- "Volume Noise Scale", scales the volume noise inside the crystal.
- "World Or Local", and "Local One To One Scale", switch between World and Local spaces.
- "Refraction", controls the refraction parameter, more = less refraction, values closed to zero = more refraction.
- "Volume Noise Exp", and "Volume Noise Multiply", emission power of the volume noise.
- "Ramp", gradient ramp texture for coloring.


HDRP:

- "MASTER Emission" is used to adjust emission based on your exposure.
