First of all, you need to unpack the right packages for your specific setup of Unity. This Asset contains three packages, for Standard, HDRP, and URP pipelines. Start with Step_1_CoreResources package, it will add all core resources (textures, scripts, and meshes) needed for this Asset. After that, pick the right SRP package and unpack it too. It will add all other components like prefabs of complete effects, scenes, materials, and shaders. If you using Standard pipeline and already have PostProcessing Stack V2 in your project, you can uncheck it when unpacking the Standard package.

ASSET DEPENDENCIES:

- BuiltIn version requeres ShaderGraph package, you can import it in Package Manager.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- (URP) Make sure, you enable HDR in URP Asset settings.
- (BuiltIn) Turn on “HDR” on your Camera, Shaders requires it.
- (All) This VFX Asset looks much better in “Linear” Color Space, but if you using “Gamma” Color Space, you need to slightly decrease the Final Power (Emission Power) material parameter of each effect. You can check it in the “Edit > Project Settings > Player” TAB.
- (All) Image Effects are necessary in order to make a great-looking game, as well as our asset. Be sure to use “ACES Tone Mapping” and “Bloom”.
- (All) Your camera must render Depth texture in order for some effects to appear correctly.



HOW TO USE:

- First of all, check the “DemoScene”, it contains all the materials and meshes and nice way to quickly preview them on various meshes.
- Check the "Prefabs" folder, it contains all the crystals with all material combinations, everything in LocalSpace.
- Check "DemoScene_UseCases" for some tips on how to use this Asset.

TIPS:

- When using Crystals for environmental design, change noise to World Space, this will add a much more natural look.
- Local space noise crystals are good for some quick design and small crystal patches.
- Check the "MostUsedParameters.txt"
